<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Borned in a small town named Jesus Carranza Ver Mex., raised by a beatiful single Mom
  named Eugenia.
  Im the midle child and I think the one the gave my mother most of the white hairs.
  Always curious about the world and quite a explorer.

</p>

<p>I arrived to the United States when I was  about 21 years old looking for better oportunities in life.
  My dream was to buid my mom a decent house and help my sibilings economically so they could continue their
  education.
  I had the oportunity to learn carpentry in Burlington NC. After appendix cirjury I had to move to Virginia and I felt in love eith it.
  while my career developed as a carpenter I was able to keep learning English since Spanish is my native languaje.
  I was sble to pick it up very quick, I think my curious personality heped a lot.
